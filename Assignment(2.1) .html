<h3>Who invented football <h3>

<p>Football as we know it today - sometimes known as association football or soccer - began in England, with the laying down of rules by the Football Association in 1863.
Since then, while the rules of the sport have gradually evolved (to the point where VAR is now used, for example), football has more or less retained the same overall constitution and objectives.
Various football games existed prior to that point in England and were played on the lawns of public schools, but with no standardised set of rules, the games were rather chaotic.
A number of different rule codes existed, such as the Cambridge rules and the Sheffield rules, meaning that there was often disagreement and confusion among players.
While no single individual can realistically lay claim to being the 'inventor' of football, Ebenezer Morley has been referred to as the 'father' of the Football Association.</p>
<p>While Morley was not one of the public schoolboys, he was the founder of Barnes Football Club, and it was his letter to the newspaper Bell's Life that prompted the historic meeting which established the new rules.
That meeting, which took place on October 26, 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern on Great Queen Street in London, involved representatives from 12 clubs and the game of football was soon codified.
Nowadays the game of football is presided over globally by FIFA, which was established in 1904 (41 years after the FA).</p>

<h3>What were the early forms of football?<h3>

<p>While those associated with football in England take pride in the fact that they can be said to be 'inventors' of modern football, other forms have been recorded elsewhere - and much earlier.
<br>Indeed, the earliest form of football is understood to be 'cuju' which was played in China during the Han dynasty from 206 BC to 220 AD.
<br>'Cuju' translates literally as 'kick ball' and the aim of the game was to kick the ball into a net. Like later forms of the game in England, cuju outlawed the use of the hands.</p>

<p>In ancient Greece, too, a game similar to football existed which was called 'episkyros'.
<br>The name of the game means 'common ball' and it involved two teams of players (with numbers comparable to football) with one ball. Notably, though, players were allowed to use their hands.
<br>'Episkyros' was frequently violent in nature and it is believed to be related somewhat to the later ancient Roman game 'harpastum', which means 'carried away'.</p>

<h3>Scotland v England: The World’s First Football International Fixture.<h3>

<p>It was on this day in 1872, the first ever official international football match was played as Scotland took on England at the West of Scotland Cricket ground at Hamilton Crescent, located in Partick.
Scotland v England is therefore the oldest international fixture in world football. International football known today stemmed from that very clash in the west end of Glasgow 145 years ago.
Indeed, there were actually five unofficial international matches played between teams representing Scotland and England  since 1870, none of which Scotland won. 
Strangely, all players selected for the Scottish sides, and England sides, in these early unofficial internationals were mainly from the London area; with majority playing for the Scotland team not actually Scottish. 
Although Scottish players from north of the border were invited to represent the Scottish team but very few took up the offer. 
It took a man called Charles Alcock, the FA General Secretary, to write a public letter in the Glasgow and Edinburgh newspapers offering a  challenge for a team made up of Scots to face a team of 11 Englishmen. 
This challenge would ignite a spark, for Queen’s Park Football Club decided to take Mr Alcock up in his offer.</p>
<0p>Robert Gardner and David Wotherspoon of Queen’s Park, whilst playing in London for a Queen’s Park FA Cup tie, stayed in the capital post-match to meet with the FA to arrange the fixture. 
The match and location were agreed between the FA and Queen’s representatives with Wotherspoon writing a letter in the Scotsman confirming the news. 
ue to Edinburgh not being accustomed to association football code, both parties agreed Glasgow would be the best location for the tie. 
Very fittingly, the match was to be played on St Andrew’s Day 30th November 1872 at the West of Scotland Cricket Ground in Partick; with admission into the ground costing a shilling (ladies were admitted free).
eople always draw the conclusion that the reason the Scotland National Team play in blue is because of the colour of the Scottish flag.</p> 
<p>However, the real tale is that the origin of the famous blue strip is from Scotland’s oldest association’s football club, Queen’s Park. 
The blue jersey was in fact the Spiders’ original strip and because Queen’s Park took the responsibility to arrange the match, the team would play in blue-whilst featuring all Queen’s Park players.
 How the lion rampant badge was adopted as the Scotland badge is a fascinating tale. Wotherspoon, who was playing the match, asked for his sister to source out lion badges to be stitched onto the jersey.
 Marion Wotherspoon used her talented skills to sew 11 lions to 11 blue shirts. What a lot of people don’t know is that the lions were actually white rather than red that has been suggested in old pictures and artwork. 
 The red lion rampant would come later in 1882. The 11 thistles, each representing a player on the field, would later feature on the club crest from the early 1950’s.
 ngland would play in white in the first official spectacle, wearing a badge consisting of three lions within a shield, in a similar stance to that of the English Coat of Arms, except that these lions were navy blue and the only distinguishable features were red eyes and mouths. 
 A red and navy crown sat upon the top of the shield.  
 It is only from 1949 that the England emblem was introduced.</p>
 <p>The current England badge only has ten Tudor Roses scattered around the three lions as they represent the ten regional divisions, each of which has a seat on the Football Association Council.
Advertising for the game was very strong in the local press, to which buses were arranged to leave from Miller Street in the the centre of Glasgow to take punters to the match. 
Around 2500 spectators attended the historical match, intrigued by a new format of football. 2pm was the official kick-off time but the game would have a fifteen minute delay due to both team’s preparations before the match.
 Images sketched by William Ralston also reveal that England players warmed up for the match whilst smoking pipes.
The Scottish captain, Bob Gardner, who would play a further four times against England and lose only once, had been responsible for team selection.
 The future Scottish Football Association president had that year made the switch from forward to goalkeeper. He kept goal for his country for the first half similar to his English counterpart, Robert Barker, who decided to join the action outfield when he switched with William Maynard.
 Gardner would return between the posts during the second half.
 Kirkie Smith was dribbling beautifully for England. They won a free-kick close to Scotland’s goal that with their great physicality up front, made the prospect of conceding a goal serious but Ker kicked the ball to safety. 
 Weir and Leckie were in fine form for Scotland, causing England concerns. Leckie after a mazy dribbling run, took a shot at goal which struck the taped goal posts but instead of going under, went over. 
 Ottaway also seen a shot saved by Gardner in the first half.
The match report from the Glasgow Herald shares: ‘Both sides were working hard, and showing excellent play. The Englishmen had all the advantage of weight, their average being two stone heavier than the Scotchmen and they had the advantage of pace. 
The strong point of the home club was that they played excellently well together.’
Indeed, both sides had contrasting styles. England’s players stated their aim to collect the ball and attempt to dribble past their markers, while the Scottish team took all by surprise; by playing a more passing game (or combination play as its described by some historians). The first of its kind ever seen, a term that would later be christened ‘Tika Taka’ in the 21st century.

<h3>Who won the first english football?<h3>

<p>After four years of debate, the Football Association finally permitted professionalism on 20 July 1885. 
<br>Before that date many clubs made payments to "professional" players to boost the competitiveness of their teams, breaking FA rules and arousing the contempt of those clubs abiding by the laws of the amateur Football Association code.[citation needed]
<br>As more and more clubs became professional the ad ho fixture list of FA Cup, inter-county, and ordinary matches was seen by many as an unreliable stream of revenue, and ways were considered of ensuring a consistent income.
<br>A director of Birmingham-based Aston Villa, William McGregor, was the first to set out to bring some order to a chaotic world where clubs arranged their own fixtures, along with various cup competitions.
<br>On 22 March 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End, Stoke and West Bromwich Albion; suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season.
 <br>His idea might have been based upon a description of a proposal for an early American college football league, publicized in the English media in 1887 which stated: "measures would be taken to form a new football league ...
 [consisting of] a schedule containing two championship games between every two colleges composing the league".</p>
 <p>The first meeting was held at Anderton's Hotel in London on 23 March 1888 on the eve of the FA Cup Final.
 The Football League was formally created and named in Manchester at a further meeting on 17 April at the Royal Hotel.
 The name "Association Football Union" was proposed by McGregor but this was felt too close to "Rugby Football Union". 
 Instead, "The Football League" was proposed by Major William Sudell, representing Preston, and quickly agreed upon.
 Although the Royal Hotel is long gone, the site is marked with a commemorative red plaque on the Royal Buildings in Market Street. 
 The first season of the Football League began a few months later on 8 September with 12 member clubs from the Midlands and north of England: Accrington, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Derby County, Everton, Notts County, Preston North End, Stoke (renamed Stoke City in 1926), West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers.<
 Each club played the others twice, once at home and once away, and two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw. 
 This points system was not agreed upon until after the season had started; the alternative proposal was one point for a win only. 
 <br>Preston won the first league title without losing a game, and completed the first league–cup double by also taking the FA Cup.

<h3>Most red cards in a game in football history<h3>

<p>As been said throughout the history that Football, and sports in general is all about respect for the opposition and moralistic considerations. And in many instances, it indeed has been like that. Remember when Ruud Gullit refused to play on in the dying moments of the final of 1992 UEFA European championship against Denmark after an opposition player suffered an injury?
How about last season in the English Championship when leeds United missed their penalty on purpose to honor the spirit of the game. In the end, they were not rewarded by the gods of football for their moralistic gesture and had to wait another season to finally get back to the premier league. However Marcello Bielsa and his players were applauded by fans all over the world for their fair play.
Having said all that, football has become more of an industry in recent decades and considering the amount of money involved, sometimes it is hard for teams and players to stay true to the moralistic norms of the game. Racism seems more uncontrollable on and off the field and players often indulge in violent brawls. The latest instance of this came last night in the heated encounter between PSG and Olympique Marseille when the referee showed 5 players their marching orders after a late brawl which first started between Neymar and Alvaro Gonzales.
With the PSG and Marseille game still in everyone's mind, in this article we want to present you with an interesting list of most red cards in a game in football history.</p>
<p ><i>14 yellow cards and 5 red cards</i></p>
<p>The most red cards in a game is  heated game between PSG and Marseille. The two teams are considered as the two giants of French football, just like Barcelona and Real Madrid are in La Liga. So it is not strange for their head-to-head encounters to turn out into violent clashes every now and then. Still what happened last night was extraordinary as an injury-time clash between players resulted in 5 red cards and possibly some more heavy punishments for the players involved.
The tension between the two teams actually started building up a few weeks before the game when PSG reached the UEFA Champions League final for the first time in their history. Marseille was the last team from French football to win the prestigious competition when they beat AC Milan 1-0 in 1993 and apparently they were not happy to share their historic achievement with their bitter rivals.
When PSG lost the final to Bayern Munchen, some of Marseille players rubbed sault in PSG player's wounds by posting provocative comments posted on their social media accounts. Dimitry Payet, for instance, trolled PSG tweeting a video of their shirt apparently with a star above the crest, only to reveal a Marseille jersey underneath.
Marseille won the game 1-0 after Florian Thauvin volleyed the ball into the PSG goal in the 31 minute. During the injury time, Neymar was sent off after hitting Alvaro Gonzales who Neymar claimed abused him verbally by Racism comments.
The incident resulted in a heavy brawl between the two team's players. Angel Di Maria mocked COVID-19 precautionary rules by spitting toward a Marseille player. Along with Neymar, His team-mates Leandro Parades and Layvin Kurzawa and Marseille duo Jordan Amavi and Dario Benedetto were sent off in one of the matches with a Shocking Amount of Red Cards.</p>

<h3>Who won most World Cups?<h3>

<p>he FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.
The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over about a month.
The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams.</p>
<p>Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France, and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain, with one title each.
The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games. The cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.[1][2][3][4]
17 countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, and Mexico have each hosted twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, Japan and South Korea (jointly), South Africa, and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar will host the 2022 tournament, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups.</p>

<h3>What country won the most UEFA European Championship<h3>

<p><p>he UEFA European Football Championship,commonly known as the UEFA European Championship and informally as the Euros, is the primary association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), determining the continental champion of Europe. 
<br>Held every four years since 1960, in the even-numbered year between World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the European Nations' Cup, changing to the current name in 1968. 
<br>Starting with the 1996 tournament, specific championships are often referred to in the form "UEFA Euro [year]"; this format has since been retroactively applied to earlier tournaments.</p>

<p>
Prior to entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. 
<br>Until 2016 the championship winners could compete in the following FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so
<br>The 15 European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain each have won three titles, 
<br>France has two titles, and the Soviet Union, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. 
<br>To date, Spain is the only team in history to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012. </p>

<p>It is the second most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[3]
The most recent championship, hosted by France in 2016, was won by Portugal, who beat France 1–0 in the final at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis after extra time. 
<br>The final also averaged 284 million viewers which is the second most viewed game in European tournament history</p>

<h3>How many Champions League Trophies are there?<h3>

<p>Here is only one Champions League trophy available to winners.

However, prior to 2009, there was a UEFA ruling that allowed any club who had won the trophy five times or three times in a row, to keep it.
<br> As a result,<i> Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Inter Milan, Liverpool and Real Madrid </i>all have their own version in their trophy rooms!
<br> This means the total number of official UEFA Champions League Trophies ever to have been made is 7.</p>
