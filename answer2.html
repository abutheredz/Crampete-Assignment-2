<h3>What were the early forms of football?<h3>

<p>While those associated with football in England take pride in the fact that they can be said to be 'inventors' of modern football, other forms have been recorded elsewhere - and much earlier.
<br>Indeed, the earliest form of football is understood to be 'cuju' which was played in China during the Han dynasty from 206 BC to 220 AD.
<br>'Cuju' translates literally as 'kick ball' and the aim of the game was to kick the ball into a net. Like later forms of the game in England, cuju outlawed the use of the hands.</p>

<p>In ancient Greece, too, a game similar to football existed which was called 'episkyros'.
<br>The name of the game means 'common ball' and it involved two teams of players (with numbers comparable to football) with one ball. Notably, though, players were allowed to use their hands.
<br>'Episkyros' was frequently violent in nature and it is believed to be related somewhat to the later ancient Roman game 'harpastum', which means 'carried away'.</p>
