<h3>Most red cards in a game in football history<h3>

<p>As been said throughout the history that Football, and sports in general is all about respect for the opposition and moralistic considerations. And in many instances, it indeed has been like that. Remember when Ruud Gullit refused to play on in the dying moments of the final of 1992 UEFA European championship against Denmark after an opposition player suffered an injury?
How about last season in the English Championship when leeds United missed their penalty on purpose to honor the spirit of the game. In the end, they were not rewarded by the gods of football for their moralistic gesture and had to wait another season to finally get back to the premier league. However Marcello Bielsa and his players were applauded by fans all over the world for their fair play.
Having said all that, football has become more of an industry in recent decades and considering the amount of money involved, sometimes it is hard for teams and players to stay true to the moralistic norms of the game. Racism seems more uncontrollable on and off the field and players often indulge in violent brawls. The latest instance of this came last night in the heated encounter between PSG and Olympique Marseille when the referee showed 5 players their marching orders after a late brawl which first started between Neymar and Alvaro Gonzales.
With the PSG and Marseille game still in everyone's mind, in this article we want to present you with an interesting list of most red cards in a game in football history.</p>
<p ><i>14 yellow cards and 5 red cards</i></p>
<p>The most red cards in a game is  heated game between PSG and Marseille. The two teams are considered as the two giants of French football, just like Barcelona and Real Madrid are in La Liga. So it is not strange for their head-to-head encounters to turn out into violent clashes every now and then. Still what happened last night was extraordinary as an injury-time clash between players resulted in 5 red cards and possibly some more heavy punishments for the players involved.
The tension between the two teams actually started building up a few weeks before the game when PSG reached the UEFA Champions League final for the first time in their history. Marseille was the last team from French football to win the prestigious competition when they beat AC Milan 1-0 in 1993 and apparently they were not happy to share their historic achievement with their bitter rivals.
When PSG lost the final to Bayern Munchen, some of Marseille players rubbed sault in PSG player's wounds by posting provocative comments posted on their social media accounts. Dimitry Payet, for instance, trolled PSG tweeting a video of their shirt apparently with a star above the crest, only to reveal a Marseille jersey underneath.
Marseille won the game 1-0 after Florian Thauvin volleyed the ball into the PSG goal in the 31 minute. During the injury time, Neymar was sent off after hitting Alvaro Gonzales who Neymar claimed abused him verbally by Racism comments.
The incident resulted in a heavy brawl between the two team's players. Angel Di Maria mocked COVID-19 precautionary rules by spitting toward a Marseille player. Along with Neymar, His team-mates Leandro Parades and Layvin Kurzawa and Marseille duo Jordan Amavi and Dario Benedetto were sent off in one of the matches with a Shocking Amount of Red Cards.</p>
