<h3>Who invented football <h3>

<p>Football as we know it today - sometimes known as association football or soccer - began in England, with the laying down of rules by the Football Association in 1863.
Since then, while the rules of the sport have gradually evolved (to the point where VAR is now used, for example), football has more or less retained the same overall constitution and objectives.
Various football games existed prior to that point in England and were played on the lawns of public schools, but with no standardised set of rules, the games were rather chaotic.
A number of different rule codes existed, such as the Cambridge rules and the Sheffield rules, meaning that there was often disagreement and confusion among players.
While no single individual can realistically lay claim to being the 'inventor' of football, Ebenezer Morley has been referred to as the 'father' of the Football Association.</p>
<p>While Morley was not one of the public schoolboys, he was the founder of Barnes Football Club, and it was his letter to the newspaper Bell's Life that prompted the historic meeting which established the new rules.
That meeting, which took place on October 26, 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern on Great Queen Street in London, involved representatives from 12 clubs and the game of football was soon codified.
