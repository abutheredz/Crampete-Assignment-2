<h3>How many Champions League Trophies are there?<h3>

<p>Here is only one Champions League trophy available to winners.

However, prior to 2009, there was a UEFA ruling that allowed any club who had won the trophy five times or three times in a row, to keep it.
<br> As a result,<i> Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Inter Milan, Liverpool and Real Madrid </i>all have their own version in their trophy rooms!
<br> This means the total number of official UEFA Champions League Trophies ever to have been made is 7.</p>
